# Module ui

This module provides pre-built UI components for the `PdfViewer` using the traditional Android View system. It complements the core `PdfViewer` from the `:core` module by providing a `PdfViewerContainer` that orchestrates a `PdfToolBar`, `PdfScrollBar`, loading indicators, and dialogs for passwords and printing.
