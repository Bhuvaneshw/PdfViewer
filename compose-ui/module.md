# Module compose-ui

This module provides pre-built UI components for the `PdfViewer` using Jetpack Compose. It complements the `PdfViewer` composable from the `:compose` module by providing a `PdfViewerContainer` that orchestrates a `PdfToolBar`, `PdfScrollBar`, loading indicators, and dialogs for passwords and printing.
